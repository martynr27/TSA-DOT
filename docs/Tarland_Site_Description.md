# Tarland Site Description 
  
## Overview
The Tarland Temporary Storage Area (TSA) is an edge-of-field soil bund located in northeast Scotland. It was constructed to intercept convergent runoff pathways from arable land and reduce muddy runoff reaching downstream properties.

The TSA fills primarily from near-surface (overland) flow and represents a small-scale headwater runoff-attenuation feature designed to mitigate local flooding and soil erosion.

## Why This Site Is Used in TSA-DOT
The Tarland TSA has an extensive, high-quality monitoring record, making it an ideal example for exploring and optimising small-scale headwater TSAs. Its long-term hydrological, soil, and topographic datasets allow Mode 1 to simulate TSA runoff attenuation performance for a given storm event.

Optimising features like the Tarland bund, representative of small TSAs that could be installed at the field scale, helps demonstrate how one well-designed TSA per field could form a practical and scalable approach to flood mitigation.
