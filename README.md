# TSA-DOT
The Temporary Storage Area Design Optimisation Tool (TSA-DOT) is a decision support tool developed in R to guide the design and optimisation of Temporary Storage Areas (TSAs) for flood mitigation. The tool supports site-specific design by allowing users to input a design storm event and key design parameters, including maximum TSA height and storage volume, outlet pipe diameter and height, and soil infiltration rate.

Using these inputs, TSA-DOT simulates the hydrological response of multiple TSA design combinations and evaluates their flood mitigation effectiveness using five metrics. The tool enables comparison and ranking of TSA designs, supporting evidence-based decision-making for effective TSA implementation.
